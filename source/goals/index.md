1. **Apply for water connection**
<p>The area where I bought land already has an existing communal well.  I need to apply to the community to have access and will probably need to pay for a connection.  Hopefully this will not be too expensive.</p>
2. **Survey land**
<p>I plan to mark the land (at least with spray paint) so that I make sure I'm building in the right place.  There's already a physical structure on the land, so I can find it approximately first</p>
