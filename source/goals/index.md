1. **Apply for water connection**
<p>The area where I bought land already has an existing communal well.  I need to apply to the community to have access and will probably need to pay for a connection.  Hopefully this will not be too expensive.</p>
2. **Survey land**
<p>I plan to mark the land (at least with spray paint) so that I make sure I'm building in the right place.  There's already a physical structure on the land, so I can find it approximately first</p>
3. **Set up camp**
  1. Make cooking area
  2. Make outhouse
  3. Make shower
<p>I decided on getting a big canvas tent for my first camp.  This way I can start to buy furniture that will one day be moved into the log cabin and, if all goes well, eventually into the tiny home.</p>
4. [**Clear trees**](/tags/clearing-trees/) 
<p>This will be a huge task! I'm excited to go all lumberjack and use the wood on the land to build something great.</p>
5. **Dry logs**
<p>Drying logs will take up to a year. It will also take a lot of dedicated space. But, hopefully, I'll learn a lot about moving logs when I pile them up.</p>
6. **Plant fruit trees**
<p>Fruit trees will take a long time to produce.  I'll probably start with some dwarf trees also, which will produce faster.  Can't have a fruit stand without fruit :)</p>
7. **First water catchment / storage**
<p>Even though there is a community well, I'd still like to build a rainwater collection system.</p>
8. **Make garden beds**
<p>While the logs are drying this will be a great time to start the garden beds. I'm planning on using no-till beds and square foot gardening techniques for maximum yield.</p>
9. **Make goat pens / hutch**
<p>Goats, I'm told, are great at clearing forested areas. So, in the uncleared area of my land I'll set up a goat area and build them a nice little house.</p>
10. **Buy goats**
<p>Two milk goats needed. Two because they're heard animals, and milk goats because I like goat cheese.</p>
11. **Dig a walipini**
<p>A walipini is an underground greenhouse from Bolivia.  Instead of digging a root cellar, I'll use this to boost year round harvesting, and I'll use the dirt I pull up to make an above ground "root cellar".</p>
12. **Build earthbag storage dome**
<p>Hopefully an earthbag structure will have sufficient thermal mass to act as a root cellar. If not, I'll use it for storing other things.</p>
13. **Build log cabin**
<p>Logs are dried, time to move out of the safari tent and into more stable digs.  This will be a one room log "cell", and I'll call it home until I can build an incredible tiny home. This will be my biggest construction project ever.</p>
14. **Larger solar system**
<p>Once a more stable house is built I'll be looking to add more modern conveniences (maybe even the Internet)... these will need more power.</p>
15. **Build a geodesic greenhouse**
  1. Potted fruit trees
  2. Aquaponic system?
<p>The Plant Hardiness zone is on the border between 6 and 7. An above ground greenhouse will be needed for some fruit trees, and to extend the growing season.  I might also add an aquaponic system - which will supply me with some fish and a thermal mass to keep the greenhouse temperature consistent.</p>
16. **Build fruit / Vegetable stand**
<p>Finally it's time to plan the stand.</p>
17. **Build solar car kit**
<p>Because I'm not too far from town, a small electric vehicle will save gas money for small trips.</p>
18. **Build incredible tiny home**
<p>All has gone well - I'm seeing some income - I feel stable and happy.  Time to make a more permanent residence. Now my log cabin can be used for guests and storage.</p>
