1. **Apply for water connection**
The area where I bought land already has an existing communal well.  I need to apply to the community to have access and will probably need to pay for a connection.  Hopefully this will not be too expensive.

2. **Survey land**
I plan to mark the land (at least with spray paint) so that I make sure I'm building in the right place.  There's already a physical structure on the land, so I can find it approximately first
  1. Price lumber removal
  2. Determine eventual location of cabin

3. **Set up camp**
I decided on getting a big canvas tent for my first camp.  This way I can start to buy furniture that will one day be moved into the log cabin and, if all goes well, eventually into the tiny home.
  1. Make cooking area
  2. Make outhouse
  3. Make shower

4. **Clear trees**
This will be a huge task! I'm excited to go all lumberjack and use the wood on the land to build something great.

5. **Dry logs**
I'll need to let the trees dry before I can use them as logs / lumber.
It'll take up to a year as well as a lot of dedicated space. But, hopefully, I'll learn a lot about moving heavy logs as I pile them up.

6. **Plant fruit trees**
Fruit trees will take a long time to produce.  I'll probably start with some dwarf trees also, which will produce faster.  Can't have a fruit stand without fruit :)

7. **First water catchment / storage**
Even though there is a community well, I'd still like to build a rainwater collection system.

8. **Make garden beds**
While the logs are drying this will be a great time to start the garden beds. I'm planning on using no-till beds and square foot gardening techniques for maximum yield.

9. **Make goat pens / hutch**
Goats, I'm told, are great at clearing forested areas. So, in the uncleared area of my land I'll set up a goat area and build them a nice little house.

10. **Buy goats**
Two milk goats needed. Two because they're heard animals, and milk goats because I like goat cheese.

11. **Dig a walipini**
A walipini is an underground greenhouse from Bolivia.  Instead of digging a root cellar, I'll use this to boost year round harvesting, and I'll use the dirt I pull up to make an above ground "root cellar".

12. **Build earthbag storage dome**
Hopefully an earthbag structure will have sufficient thermal mass to act as a root cellar. If not, I'll use it for storing other things.

13. **Build log cabin**
Logs are dried, time to move out of the safari tent and into more stable digs.  This will be a one room log "cell", and I'll call it home until I can build an incredible tiny home. This will be my biggest construction project ever.

14. **Larger solar system**
Once a more stable house is built I'll be looking to add more modern conveniences (maybe even the Internet)... these will need more power.

15. **Build a geodesic greenhouse**
The Plant Hardiness zone is on the border between 6 and 7. An above ground greenhouse will be needed for some fruit trees, and to extend the growing season.  I might also add an aquaponic system - which will supply me with some fish and a thermal mass to keep the greenhouse temperature consistent.
  1. Potted fruit trees
  2. Aquaponic system?

16. **Build fruit / Vegetable stand**
Finally it's time to plan the stand.

17. **Build solar car kit**
Because I'm not too far from town, a small electric vehicle will save gas money for small trips.

18. **Build incredible tiny home**
All has gone well - I'm seeing some income - I feel stable and happy.  Time to make a more permanent residence. Now my log cabin can be used for guests and storage.

19. **Get a dog**
Comfortable house, financially stable enough to buy dog food... I'll get myself an animal companion!
