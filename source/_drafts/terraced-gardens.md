The land has a semi-cleared level area where there is already a small gazebo.

The rest of the land has a small wet-season stream running through the middle, so it has north sloping and south sloping regions.

Perfect!  South facing slopes are great for growing vegetables. North facing slopes are great for many fruit trees.

I understand the soil in Northern Arkansas is sandy and rocky, which isn't so much of a problem for the trees, but will be a problem for the garden beds I want to add in on the southern slope.

In these beds I'll be trying out lasagna gardening and terra preta (mixing in charcoal and live yogurt).
