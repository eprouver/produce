This is it!  I finally found a plot of land in the garden of Eden.

Well, actually Arkansas... which is just as good.

The piece of land is 5 wooded acres and already has a small gazebo built on the property.

**Location Benefits**:
 - Affordable enough to not break the bank
 - Has optional access to a communal well
 - Is only about a mile away from fishing
 - Is really close to a highway so I can sell fruit

**Known Risks**:
 - I bought it sight unseen (I'm currently working in Argentina, so no way to visit)
 - The land is slopey = more effort, but more beautiful.

The land has both southern slope, for my vegetables, and a northern slope for my fruit trees. I'll need to do some terracing to create sutable beds.

The slopes are covered with old oak trees. At first I was just goung to use them to build the terraces and log cabin... but it seems like they might be worth more at the saw mill.  So i'll want to price them first.
