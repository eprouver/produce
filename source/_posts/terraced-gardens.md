The land has a semi-cleared level area where there is already a small gazebo.

The rest of the land has a small wet-season stream running through the middle, so it has north sloping and south sloping regions.

Perfect!  South facing slopes are great for growing vegetables. North facing slopes are great for many fruit trees.
