Ever since high school, I've traveled a lot.  I've been an actor in Paris, an English teacher in Shanghai, a programmer in Buenos Aires, with stints in California, Gibraltar, and Florida.

It's great to see the world and travel, but recently I've been working more than I've been living.

I need to build my own life, not trade my time to buy one.

So I decided to [return home to the USA](/tags/heading-home/), [take the money I have saved so far](/finances/), [buy some land in Arkansas](/tags/land), [go off-grid](/tags/homestead), [grow a self-sufficient garden and fruit orchard](/tags/gardening), and try to open a [roadside fruit and vegetable stand](/tags/fruit-stand).

This is the blog I've created to document my experience.

I'm also trying to supplement my income by creating content, so if you see anything you enjoy, please subscribe and share.

Thank you!
