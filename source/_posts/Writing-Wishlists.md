Here is wishlist of products I made for stage 1: Settling.
<!-- more -->

The longest journey usually begins with a lot of research, anxiety, and procrastination... "Where to plant the first step?" For me, it was Amazon wishlists and the <a target="_BLANK" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-wish-list-total/boekbkconiendicldakeboooeilaldmh">Wishlist Total Chrome Plugin</a>.

It keep me excited and made me get real about cost expectations... even if many items could be found cheaper or second-hand, better to over budget, amirite!?
