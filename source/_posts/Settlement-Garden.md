I want to get my feet wet with gardening and start to grow some food as soon as possible. So I'm going to set up a victory garden to grow some vegetables ASAP.

Victory gardens were planted in the US and abroad during both world wars as a way to offset the pressure on the national food supply during wartime. In my case, my victory garden will hopefully offset some of my food costs, but also will serve to start the greening of my thumbs and lead to an early food-based victory for my project.

According to [growthis.com](http://www.growthis.com/12-fastest-growing-vegetables/) the fastest vegetables to grow are:
 - radishes
 - green onions
 - lettuce
 - baby carrots
 - spinach
 - kale & other leafy greens
 - peas
 - bush beans
 - turnips
 - cucumber
 - squash

I don't want to grow all of these, but I'll try to grow maybe three (depending on what is most seasonally appropriate).
