This is it!  I finally found a plot of land in the garden of Eden.

Well, actually Arkansas... which is just as good.

The piece of land is 5 wooded acres and already has a small gazebo built on the property.

**Location Benefits**:
 - Affordable enough to not break the bank
 - Has optional access to a communal well
 - Is only about a mile away from fishing
 - Is really close to a highway so I can sell fruit

**Known Risks**:
 - I bought it sight unseen (I'm currently working in Argentina, so no way to visit)
